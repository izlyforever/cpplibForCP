# cpplibForCP

C++17 (-O2) template for competitive programming algorithms, which contains numerous math algorithms.

- Aims: build a stable, fast, easy-to-read C++ template.(the more you use it, the more reliable it is)
- Document: [English version](https://izlyforever.github.io/cpplibforCP), [Chinese version](https://izlyforever.github.io/cpplibforCP/cn) for addition, and many comments in the code.
- Reference: [CP-algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/), [AtCoder](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library) and many awesome blogs, for instance [zscoder](https://codeforces.com/profile/zscoder) posted in codeforces.
- Additional Chinese Reference: [OI-wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/) and [LuoGu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/)
- Test: [Welcome Your Test](test), almost all algorithms are tested in [LuoGu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/)
- Mkdocs: The Document page is build with Material for MkDocs

> It's really hard to give a reference for every algorithm (in English).
