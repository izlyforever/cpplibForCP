- Useage: `C++17` is required, `O2` is suggested, ~~`g++` is needed since some builtin functions have been used~~(clang also support it)
- Categories: math, date structure, graph theory, geometry, mixed
- Index: begin with 0, unless otherwise state

## Note

- algorithm name end with `S` means simple and slow, 
- Non-constant member variables are terminated with `_` to distinguish local variables,
- `std::move` and `std::forward` are used for performance

## commom ideals

- Dynamic programming
- Bisection
- Binary lifting
- Blocking
- Divide and Conquer
- Meet in Middle
- Small to Large

## A few words

- Think twice, code once
- Talk is cheap, show me the code
- More is different
